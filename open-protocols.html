	<h1>Open Protocol to Fix the Internet</h1>
	<p>Instagram and Twitter are homomorphic with respect to fundamental structures of communication. In both, individual users broadcast a feed of media to the platform, and receive broadcasts from other users either by subscribing directly to their feed or by browsing a selection of media curated by a personalized algorithm.</p>
	<p>That the two platforms exist constitutes a redundancy. This is not equivalent to the redundant selection of functionally similar food products available to citizens of developed nations. In the case of similar foods, one brand of wheat flour is interoperable with other ingredients and with other brands of wheat flour. In contrast, one cannot broadcast a tweet on Instagram, nor can they view one. Additionally, third-party client software could not effectively aggregate content hosted on these platforms, as accessing the data is locked behind proprietary protocols.</p>
	<p>In trying to diagnose dysfunctions of the modern internet, society has agreed on two related points:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The proprietary, opaque algorithms underlying content curation on the major platforms has profound consequences on participating societies. These societies begin to reflect the structures that emerge from the complex web of associative data connections which drive the algorithms. A messy mixture global and local maximums (roughly correspondent to <em>niches</em> or <em>communities</em>) ebb and flow, caricaturing the way culture evolves within all societies.</li>
		<li>Monetary incentives to drive engagement on the platforms leads to both a bias towards sensationalism, as well as an encouragement to spend as much time scrolling for more content as possible.</li>
